# Quarkus Architecture Istio

Evolution of [quarkus-architecture](https://github.com/serrodcal/quarkus-architecture) project. In this new project, the goal is to use [Istio](https://istio.io) as Service Mesh.

Replace security, monitoring or resilience features in Quarkus delegating these features 
to Istio. So, Quarkus will only have the business logic.

The main adventage is to be able to build a native application, this is lighter artifacts, 
better boot time and less resource fingerprint.
